Although the project has recently commenced, no developers have initiated the implementation phase. However, the first segment of the project, encompassing the design and specification of all functionalities and features for the initial version, has been successfully completed. A meticulously crafted plan, including a timeline outlining the projected start of the coding phase, has been established. Upon joining the project, developers will promptly engage in coding activities, with the opportunity to contribute their perspectives and suggest improvements or changes to the initial design. This collaborative approach reflects our commitment to continuous enhancement, striving to make each subsequent version superior to its predecessor.
